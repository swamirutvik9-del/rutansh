<h1>Rutansh</h1>

<p><strong>This is Rutansh.</strong></p>

<p>
Not a news portal.<br>
Not a political party.<br>
Not an ideology.
</p>

<p>
Rutansh is a long-term thinking space — to understand <strong>Bharat</strong>,
responsibility, systems, and the cost of short-term decisions.
</p>

<p>
Every article here is written calmly, analytically, and without allegiance to
any party or religion.
</p>

<p>
This is documentation of thought.<br>
Read slowly. Return weekly.
